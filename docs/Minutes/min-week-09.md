# Meeting plan:
- Introduction of today's agenda, naming the chair and minute taker. (2 min)
  - Notes: introduction carried out.
- Check of approval of the agenda (does everyone accept the agenda) (1 min)
  - Notes: everybody approves.
- TA Announcements (10 min)
  - Notes:
    - `Code freeze` deadline moved to Sunday 23:59
    - `Buddycheck` deadline next week (Friday) – refer to rubric items, be respectful, treat it as a checklist for what you have to include
but don't overthink it
    - README file: it's done, uploaded on GitLab, only needs an AI disclaimer
    - Making anymore changes is not recommended unless something critical needs to be fixed
- Compare expected work and work done (1.5 min x 5 = 7.5 min)
  - Notes:
    - Hiroki: integrated websockets to the client and some server-side changes
    - Teo: fixed printing (both wrong ingredient format, and the print job cutting off pages, so changed to .txt format printing), 
fixed nutritional values for recipes, inferred kcal/100g and kcal/portion (serving size).
    - Emilis: README file, bug fixes, recipe nutritional values
    - George: not assigned anything originally, added score-based search (e.g., recipe titles worth more than steps), bug fixes, UI refinements, dark mode and light mode, 
flags for languages, adding ingredients works like recipes now, i.e., when in ingredient tab, `+` adds ingredients, translated remaining alerts/pop-ups.
    - Lukas: removing ingredient bug (== instead of .equals), showing name of deleted favourites, ingredient kcal estimate, renamed nutritional calculations, checks for
how many recipes an ingredient is used in
    - Overall: everything achieved, all user epics completed
- TA questions (5 min)
  - Notes:
    - There were no major questions asked, only clarifications specified elsewhere in the notes.
- Show final UI (3 min)
  - Notes:
    - UI demonstration carried out, all features displayed
    - TODO: update [README.md](/README.md) to feature that AI has been used for a short part of WebSocketTest 
- Summary of meeting (2 min)
  - Notes:
    - TA announcements
    - compared what we set out to do and what we actually achieved
    - showed final UI
    - clarified some details about bugs, readme, UI, etc.
- End the meeting with a 20-second countdown, if questions arise, the countdown will be reset (1 min)
