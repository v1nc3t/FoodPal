Attitude & Relation
Quick Summary: Good
Feedback:

The team dynamic was good, there weren't long silent moments and the members were enthusiastic about participating.
The team collaborated on solving problems together and decisions were made together.
If you notice a team member being silent/not participating as much in one week, make sure to involve them in the conversation by addressing them directly. I think you did well but there is of course room for improvement.
