Chair performance
Quick Summary: Good
Feedback:

The chair followed the agenda well, and the transition from one point to another was clear. I noticed that team members dominated the discussion, maybe a bit too much. The chair should be the main person in charge and give the word to the members to speak. Spontaneous conversation is good, but the chair should be in control, making the decisions.  

Attitude & Relation
Quick Summary: Excellent
Feedback:

The team attitude was good as always, the members were supportive of each other and the discussions were respectful. 

Potentially Shippable Product

Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team
Quick Summary: Good
Feedback:

The discussion about past work was well done, everyone spoke and gave relevant information. The task distribution for next week was decided with all members' input. I would say the involvement was roughly equal.
