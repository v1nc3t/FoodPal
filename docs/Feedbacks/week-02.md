### Attitude & Relation

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: 

- The team took ownership of the meeting. 
- Most members were active and involved in the discussion; the overall atmosphere was constructive/friendly but also professional. 
- Some team members were less active than others. It is very natural and understanable but I suggest inviting members into the decision making when that happens and keeping an eye on it.

Quick Summary: N.A. 

- the progress so far is more than sufficient and the demo was clear and concise.

### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Quick Summary: Good

- As this was the first meeting it was more than sufficient to go over the tasks accomplished but dedicate more time on reflecting on the past week's process/difficulties as the amount of work grows.
-The distribution for this week was well thought and reasonable. 

Overall: Good job, keep up the good work!
