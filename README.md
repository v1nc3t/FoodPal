# CSEP Template Project

This repository contains the template for the CSE project. Please extend this README.md with sufficient instructions that will illustrate for your TA and the course staff how they can run your project.

To run the template project from the command line, you either need to have [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) installed on your local system (`mvn`) or you need to use the Maven wrapper (`mvnw`). You can then execute

	mvn -pl server -am spring-boot:run

to run the server and

	mvn -pl client -am javafx:run

to run the client. Please note that the server needs to be running, before you can start the client.

Get the template project running from the command line first to ensure you have the required tools on your sytem.

Once it is working, you can try importing the project into your favorite IDE. Especially the client is a bit more tricky to set up there due to the dependency on a JavaFX SDK.
To help you get started, you can find additional instructions in the corresponding README of the client project.
